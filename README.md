## Known Bugs

* When playing vs Computer:
  * When the computer finishes rolling normally without breaking the process, its score is not showed at the moment, but afterwards when it rolls a second time.
  * During the time the computer rolls, instead for the user's **roll** and **hold** buttons to be disabled, they are usable.
  * When the user rolls a 1 in either case, it is so fast that it's not even visible and the computer rolls immediately.
